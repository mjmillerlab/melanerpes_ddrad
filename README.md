### File 1: melanerpes_ddrad_autosome_allsnps.nex
This file is all SNS from the autosome dataset for all 105 samples sequenced. This includes outgroup species (which increases the number of SNPs). We score heterozygous sites with the IUAPAC ambiguity code for the consensus basecall (i.e. G/C -> Y).

This file is used to generate the SplitsTree network and the RAXML tree.
